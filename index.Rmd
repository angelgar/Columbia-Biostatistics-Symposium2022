## Practicum Symposium 2022

Thank you so much for joining us in celebrating the Biostatistics Master's class of 2022! In order to celebrate their work, we will have the oppurtunity to hear them present on their practicum projects. Unfortunately, due to the high volume of students, there will be parallel presentations within each session. To help you choice which you would like to attend, you can find a list of presenters, titles, and abstracts in each room.

Big thanks to the Sympoisum Planning Committee!
