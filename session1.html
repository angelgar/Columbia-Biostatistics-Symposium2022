<p><strong><em>Longitudinal Analysis of Medication Adherence Data on Patient recover from Cardiovascular Disease with Missing Responses and Missing Covariate</em></strong></p>
<p>Patients recover from cardiovascular disease require life-time medication, and their medication adherence are key to their long-term health outcomes. The study enrolled 300 patients and recorded their daily medication adherence with a electronic device and try to understand the key factors for predicting patient’s medication adherence with their hospital records.The data have both incomplete response and covariates. We use inverse probability weighting (IPW) to account for the bias of coefficient estimate after we model the missing pattern at Missing-At-Random assumption.We make inference on patient’s covariates collected during hospitalization and explore how to manage patient’s medication adherence during hospitalization.</p>

<p><strong><em>Derivation of a COPD Risk Score leveraging NHLBI Pooled Cohort Studies</em></strong></p>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. There is an urgent need to identify patients with increased COPD risk and/or ‘early stage’ COPD to target risk reduction strategies (such as smoking cessation) and to include high-risk groups in primary prevention trials. In this project, we aim to build risk prediction models for COPD.Respiratory outcome and relevant risk factors from nine NIH-funded cohort studies have been harmonized and are used.We explored the Cox models and machine learning tools for time-to-event data. Final model was chosen based on cross-validation by comparing discrimination and calibration measures including concordance index and Brier score.</p>

<p><strong><em>Stimulated Immune Responses by TruCulture Whole Blood Assay in Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) with Exercise Tolerance Test</em></strong></p>
<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a heterogeneous, chronic disorder that affects 1.5 to 2.5 million people in the United States(1)with female to male ratio up to 6:1(2).Lack of awareness about ME/CFS is widespread with 90 percent of people with ME/CFS undiagnosed or misdiagnosed(3).The pathobiology of ME/CFSis poorly understood. In this study, we conducted generalized linear mixed-effect models to compare levels of cytokines in response to different stimuli between ME/CFS group and control group before and after exercise tolerance test.Analyses of data from 108 subjects(56 ME/CFS patients, 52 healthy controls)revealed that levels of CXCL5,IL-1β,IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-23, and TNF-αwere expressed higher in individuals with ME/CFS, compared to age,sex, and race/ethnicity matched controls, following exposure to the super antigen Staphylococcus aureusenterotoxin type B(SEB). Cytokine levels were higher in women than in man and were highest in women above 45 years old who have lower plasma levels of 17β-estradiol [E2]. These findings could provide insights into the pathobiology of ME/CFS.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Evaluation of A Structural Intervention to Integrate Sexual and Reproductive Health into Public Sector HIV Care in Cape Town, South Africa: Masivukeni Pilot Study</em></strong></p>
<p>HIV continues to be a major global public health issue,and there is no cure for HIV infection. At the end of 2020,there were an estimated 37.7 million [30.2-45.1 million] people living with HIV over two thirds of whom (25.4 million) are in the WHO African Region.This study emerges from the collective experience of US and South Africa(SA)investigative teams that have devoted research and clinical careers to addressing the health and mental health needs of people affected by HIV, poverty, substance abuse, and mental illness. We pilot an intervention to be delivered by lay counselors to improve SA patients’adherence to the advent of large-scale antiretroviral treatment (ART)and health care, utilizing treatment support partners and multimedia technology. This two-phase study included a pilot randomized control trial (RCT) at Hout Bay Main Road clinic. After enrollment and completion of the Baseline Assessment, participants will be randomized to receive either Masivukeni(MSV) or standard-of-care (SOC). The primary behavioral outcome is ART adherence will be assessed with Wisepill, an electronic monitoring system and also by self-report. The randomization test on the mean percentage of adherence (assessed by Wisepill) in the 1-month period prior to the 12-month post-ART-initiation assessment point showed that there is no significant difference between two groups. The primary biological outcomes are HIV viral load and CD4count. We compared MSV and SOC in terms of the improvement from 4 months to 12 months post-ART-initiation on the odds of having undetectable HIV viral load and from baseline to 12 months post-ART-initiation on CD4 count. The logistic regression analysis for these comparisons showed that there is no significant no significant difference between two groups in both biological outcomes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Exploratory Analysis of Impact of COVID19 on Fertility</em></strong></p>
<p>The study was aimed at exploring the impact of Covid-19 lockdown on fertility-related variables, including pregnancy, marriage rate, domestic violence, contraceptive use as well as assessing the association between HIV and modern contraception.The study is a longitudinal cohort study among 8 regions where RCCS activities happened after the first COVID outbreak. Two periods were considered: before 21st March 2020 (R18) when COVID was first identified, and schools closed and the period after Covid was confirmed (R19).Most study population has the primary inclusion criteria of 15-24 years old participants, while some studies have a slightly different criterion.Data were analyzed by descriptive analysis using tables and graphs, and two-sample Z test were utilized for proportion hypothesis testing. R (4.1.0), STATA17, SAS and tableau were used to generate forms, graphs and tables.As an abstract,COVID lockdown did have impacts on fertility. After COVID lockdown carried out, pregnancy history status and pregnancy rate significantly decreased, as well as marriage rate in a majority of the 8 regions being evaluated. Contraceptive use was decreasing but remaining similar distribution patterns as pre-lockdown times. Trends were implying that it is less likely to get HIV if someone is a contraceptive user, and domestic violence showed significant gender-based differences.Our study provided many prospective suggestions on further analysis. In R20, more regions fully carried out COVID regulation policies and more specific questions would be applied to these newly collected participants, including the intended pregnancy on contraceptive failure analysis, contraceptive start time for adjusting confounders in contraceptive-HIV association analysis, further domestic violence follow-up to describe whether domestic violence had become severe as the epidemic goes tense (delta and omicron). Marriage and pregnancy would have more rounds of data to generate scatterplots, which was not able to perform in this study because R19 is the first round with COVID, as well as model fitting and making predictions on future data if lockdown policy continues.Final tip: As the lockdown policy is coming to an end in 2022, we believe that the data collected in R19 (2020-2021) and R20 (2021-2022), accompanied with further completed analysis and predictions, would work as a precious resource for public health policy decision.</p>

<p><strong><em>Multiplexed Analysis of Drug-Induced Transcript Regulation</em></strong></p>
<p>Direct and precise programming of cell function is a promising area of study for cell therapy discovery and design. Immune cells like T cells enter into exhaustive states that inhibit their ability to attack tumor cells in tumor-immune microenvironements. Cell state like T cell exhaustion is associated with a unique signature of up and down regulated protein transcripts. Ultraspecific targeting of the transcription of proteins related to T cell exhaustion may allow researchers to alter a cell’s state, and therefore function, through molecular level controls and switches. The goal of the research is to quantify the transcription efficiency of specific genes caused by drug-induced regulation of promoters. For the experiment, the group was interested in studying how a small molecule drug affects the transcription efficiency of 30 unique promoter sequences. To do so, they designed a library that includes 30 promoters (one per plasmid), a CDS (eg. GFP), and a barcode (15N) in the 3’ UTR. These constructs were then integrated into a human cell line. Researchers then measured how the number of transcripts coming from each promoter changed overtime with respect to whether the samples were drugged or not. RNA-seq was performed everyday for 4 days and only the barcodes in the 3’ UTR were sequenced. The drug had an observable up-regulation effect on three promoters and an observable down-regulation effect on two promoters.</p>

<p><strong><em>Genome-wide Association for Trait Loci of Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase in IBD Clinical Isolates of Candida Albicans</em></strong></p>
<p>Chron’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are the two primary types of Inflammatory Bowel Disease(IBD). While the pathogenesis of IBD remains unclear, several studies have observed bacterial dysbiosis in the gut. Alongside bacterial dysbiosis, fungal microbiota is also skewed in IBD, specifically an increased proportion of Candida Albicans when compared with healthy guts.C. albicans colonization is linked to exacerbated inflammation. While many studies have tried to uncover human disease risk loci in association with IBD, few studies have tried to link fungal genes to increased IBD risk. The aim of this study is to identify potential genes of C. albicans that increase damaging and inflammation potential in the gut. Here, we used genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to identify loci involved in increased damaging potential by analyzing 196,382 SNPs and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration in 48 clinical isolates of C. albicans isolated by the Iliev Lab. SNPs are identified in each isolate and passed through a filter to only include high quality and non-rare SNPs. Population structure analysis suggests the presence of four distinct population, with LDH distributed relatively evenly across populations. GWA was conducted treating LDH as both a quantitative trait and binary trait and identified three SNPs with strong associations in both analyses. One SNP falls within the coding region of the ECE1 gene, which is linked to virulence factors of C. albicans. The other two SNPs are still in need of functional validation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Deriving a gene signature for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus with high diagnostic accuracy using a multi-cohort analysis framework</em></strong></p>
<p>Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), the most common form of lupus is a type of chronic autoimmune disease. Symptom manifestations can range from skin rashes and oral ulcers to lupus nephritis, a severe form of the disease that affects the kidneys. Although lupus affects people of all ages, women particularly in their reproductive age are 9 times as likely as men to develop SLE. The prevalence rates vary based on ethnic groups with Asian, African American, African Caribbean and Hispanic American individuals having a higher incidence than White individuals in United States and European countries.The heterogeneity of symptoms among SLE patients makes it difficult to have high diagnostic accuracy in a clinical setting. There is a need for a robust diagnostic approach that can reflect all possible different risk groups and severity of the disease.Multiple studies have identified differentially expressed genes and long non-coding RNAs between SLE and healthy controls. Using the MetaIntegrator framework in this project, which performs a multi-cohort analysis of multiple heterogeneous transcriptome datasets,a set of 93 differentially expressed genes in the blood of SLE patients in comparison to healthy controls was identified. In this analysis,multicohort gene expression analysis consisting of more than 4000 samples of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)captures biological (age, sex, disease severity) and technical (microarray platform) heterogeneity to increase applicability in the real world.</p>

<p><strong><em>Association Study for Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease</em></strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative illness characterized by dementia that typically begins with subtle or poorly recognized failure of memory, then slowly becoming more severe and incapacitating. Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), where age at onset&gt;65 years, is the most common form of AD with 13% of Americans &gt;65 years of age, and 43% &gt;85 years of age affected. Existing literature has suggested AD to be genetically heterogeneous with an estimated heritability of 60% to 80%ii.Genome Wide Association Analysis(GWAS) is an approach used in genetics research to associate specific genetic variations with particular diseases.In this study, we conduct GWAS on 1068 families with European, African American and Caribbean Hispanic ancestry to identify common and rare variants conferring risk of Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease. Then we performed the same analysis as was done for the AD family data on case-control data from ADSP to replicate our findings. The primary data processing steps included quality control and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify and exclude outliers.For the common variant analysis, we use the generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT), which fits a logistic mixed model once per GWAS and performs score tests under the null hypothesis that there is no association between a binary trait and individual genetic variants.For rare variant aggregate analysis, we applied the variant set mixed model association tests (SMMAT), which includes an efficient hybrid test (SMMAT-E) that combines the fixed effect burden test and SKAT.Lastly, we conducted meta-analysis using METAL to combine the results from both the single variant and rare variant aggregate association analysis across the three populations.For GMMAT analysis of single variants the three populations (Hispanic, European and African)each show significant associations with the APOE region with p-values ranging from 1.2 x 10-18to 1.4x10-11.For rare variants, after summarizing the meta-analysis results from all variant sets and population, we identified six loci that appear most frequently in the significance list. Out of the six loci, only one of them have previously been identified to have a direct relationship with Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

<p><strong><em>Parental exposure to pesticide and childhood retinoblastoma: a retrospective case-control study in Mexico</em></strong></p>
<p>The current statistics has shown that among children younger than 15 who are diagnosed with cancer, 2% of them have retinoblastoma which is the most common childhood eye cancer. The goal of this study is to examine whether there is an association between parental exposure to pesticide and childhood retinoblastoma. It was a retrospective case-control study conducted in Mexico. The data were collected from 23 states, 244 municipalities and 293 localities, which included the mapping data about the percentage of cropland, and the questionnaire data related to pesticide exposures before and during pregnancy, designed separately for fathers and mothers. Among all diagnosed children, there were 122 bilateral cases and 266 unilateral cases. 140 children without retinoblastoma were included as controls. Logistic regression models were built with the outcome of developing disease and risk factors. Analyses were repeated for three case-control pairs, that is, all cases-control, unilateral-control and bilateral-control. Retinoblastoma was significantly associated with locality density of cropland (p&lt;0.05; odds ratio [OR], 1.011; confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.021), but not pesticide exposures. Similarly, for unilateral disease it was observed that the outcome was significantly associated with the cropland percentage under locality level (p&lt;0.05; OR, 1.011; CI, 1.001-1.022). However, the bilateral case was not significantly associated with either the cropland percentage or the pesticide exposures. The results suggest that the locality cropland density may contribute to the development of unilateral retinoblastoma. The data of occupational and domestic exposure to pesticide might be biased due to a possible propensity of mothers filling in the questionnaire for fathers. Also, there might be a recall bias in the retrospective study. Therefore, further exploration need to be done for more informative and reliable results.</p>

<p><strong><em>Cross-Sectional Analyses on School Variable</em></strong></p>
<p>I was part of the Rakai Health Sciences Program and worked on the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), an ongoing epidemiological cohort study in Rakai District of southwestern Uganda. My practicum project aimed to conduct cross-sectional analyses that focus on the newly captured “in-school” variable in the Round 19 (R19) baseline and follow-up survey. Using the new in-school variable, I explored the association between the school attainment and structural factors, social transition, and risk behaviors among adolescents and young adults (AYA) in Rakai, Uganda.Data from R19 survey of the RCCS was used to assess demographic factors, social determinants, structural factors, and marital experiences among 15-24 years old men and women. The key outcome variable of interest includes school enrollment and occupation. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was first performed on variables of interest. Then Cohen’s Kappa test statistic was performed to access the agreement between the occupation variable vs. the in-school variables. Lastly, logistic regression models were fitted to figure out the association between the “in-school” variable and structural factors, social transition factors, and risk behaviors.In the past, members on the team relied on the Occupation variable to determine whether a respondent is in school. In R19, new question was introduced, directly asking respondent whether they are currently in school. The agreement between school attainment and the derived version from the occupation variables was accessed and I discovered that the occupation variable did a good job at capturing the in-school status. I also found that in structural factors, having dead parent/parents and live-indifferent communities, moving away from city and lower SES status increase the odds of not being in school; in social transition factors, pregnancy and marriage increase the odds of not being in school; in risk behaviors, multiple partners and alcohol before sex increase the odds of not being in school.The primary study objective to identify the agreement among the in-school status, the new variable created based on two occupation questions. My work serves as an internal validity test for other team members’ studies. Secondary study objectives include identifying the association between in-school status and structural factors (orphanhood, SES, and community type), social transitions (pregnancy, marriage), and risk behaviors (multiple partners, alcohol before sex).</p>

<p><strong><em>Investigating the Association Between Patient Outcomes and Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Education with DNP-or MSN-Preparation</em></strong></p>
<p>The Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) was voted as the most adequate degree for nursing practitioners (NP) by members of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing in 2004. Comparing to the Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), DNP degree is designed to offer NPs advanced clinical practice skills and professional knowledge, which may allow NPs to work more independently and bring them more strengthens in quality improvement, practice management, information technology literacy and leadership. Therefore, DNP has been adopted, while the MSN has been eliminated by many nursing school in recent years. However, the association between DNP preparation and patient outcomes has not been investigated by any studies. Hence, this study aims to investigate the association between education received by NPs and patient outcomes. The data was collected from the primary care NPs survey from six diverse states. Among the total of 626 NPs, DNP (n = 59) or MSN (n = 567) was identified as their terminal degree. The survey dataset was merged with the Medicare claims data for Medicare beneficiaries (n = 48182), including 43867 beneficiaries distributed to MSN and 4315 beneficiaries distributed to DNP. The chronic condition of beneficiaries was also attributed to all NPs. Acute care hospitalizations, Ambulatory Care Sensitive(ACS)hospitalizations, ED visits, Ambulatory Care Sensitive (ACS) ED visits are identified as the binary outcome variables. Covariates were controlled for both NP level and patient level. Independent t test was performed to test the association between independent variable, NP education, and continuous covariates. Otherwise, 𝜒2test was performed for categorical covariates. The multiple exact logistic models were used to estimate the unadjusted and adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) of four outcomes attributed to MSN-and DNP-prepared NPs. The clustering effect of patients within NPs was accounted by the adjusted standard errors using a sandwich estimator. Rates of overall ED visits (OR = 1.135; 99% confidence interval (CI): (0.959,1.343)), ACS ED visits (OR = 1.099; 99% CI: (0.909,1.327)), overall hospitalizations (OR = 1.099; 99% CI: (0.850,1.418)), and ACS hospitalizations (OR = 1.231; 99% CI: (0.835,1.815)) were slightly higher for beneficiaries attributed to MSN-prepared NPs, with insignificant difference at the 1% level. The scope of practice (p-value = 0.0009) was identified as significant covariate at NP level. Age(p-value &lt; 0.0001), gender(p-value &lt; 0.0001), race(p-value &lt; 0.0001), hypertension (p-value = 0.0002), and congestive heart failure (p-value = 0.0088) were identified as significant covariates at patient level. This study did not find significant differences in ED visits and hospitalization among patients receiving primary care from MSN-and DNP-prepared NPs, which infers that even though DNP education adds more requirements for NPs, it has not yet been reflected by improvements in patient outcomes. The small sample size of DNP-prepared NPs could be one limitation of this study. Otherwise, the data were collected from only six states, which may not be diverse enough to represent the whole population. However, this study is the first study to investigate the association between NP education (MSN or DNP) and patient outcomes. On the other hand, as more and more nursing schools are adopting DNP programs, which will bring more DNP-prepared NPs entering the primary care field, it is still meaningful to investigate the influence of DNP-prepared primary care effect on patients to further identify the function of the DNP degree in the future NP education</p>

<p><strong><em>The Association of Infant Growth and Maternal Factors in Bangladesh</em></strong></p>
<p>Infant growth is highly related to kinds of maternal factors during gestation and in the first 24 months of life1. The Bangledish’s stunting prevalence ranked 23rd highest out of 136 countries. 43% of children under the age of five are stunted2. The researchers conducted a prospective, controlled, blinded, randomized study to assess the association of infant growth and kinds of maternal variables with 24 weeks follow up. 340 mothers were assigned to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine(treatment) or the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine(control). The results show that whether infants are infected with flu is significantly associated with the influenza vaccine(RR=0.38, p=0.03) and breast milk(RR = 3.06, p=0.005). Infant in the treatment group is 0.62 times less likely to have fever than the control group with p=0.002. Whether infants have diarrheal disease is associated with breast milk( RR=1.78, p=0.0003) and mother education level(RR= 1.82, p=0.0037). Infants whose mother’s education level is below a bachelor’s degree are 1.44 (p=0.001) times more likely to have cough than infants whose mother with a higher education level.In conclusion, maternal variables like influenza immunization, education level, breast milk, smoke are important factors of infant growth which can be a strategy for improvement of infant health and growth in Bangladesh.</p>

<p><strong><em>The influence of household environment on children’s brain development and behavioral problems</em></strong></p>
<p>This study uses data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, which is a prospective longitudinal study focusing on nearly 12000 9-10-year-old children from 21 research sites in the US that aims to improve the development of American youth. In our study, we explore the influence of children’s household environment (household income, parents’ education level, and social support) on children’s brain development and behavior problems. Descriptive statistics are used to show the distribution of behavior problems and brain volume among different demographic subgroups, and two sample T-tests, ANOVA tests, and Pearson correlation are used to test univariate relationships between predictors and children’s brain volume and behavior problems. Linear regression models are used to further explore the relationships, and mediation models are used to assess whether brain development explains relationships between predictors and behavioral problems. The aim of this study is to use scientific results to better understand what helps children grow better and reduce inequities.</p>

<p><strong><em>Metal Mixture and Incident Cognitive Impairment using Quantile-Based g-Computation Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>Background: Previous research has shown the potential linkage between trace elements and cognitive function. However, most studies focused on individual elements. This study used Qgcomp to study the joint effects of metal mixture on cognitive impairment in a cohort of US adults.Methods: The study sample included 2071 participants from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Five relative important metals (Mg, Ca, Zn, As, Cd) were selected as mixture components though comparing metals’ t-statistic in generalized linear model trained with cross-validation. Primary outcome was defined with enhanced cognitive battery (ECB) tests to determine participant’s domain-based cognitive function impairment. The association of the metal mixtures with the incident cognitive impairment was evaluated using Qgcomp analysis, which allows flexibility on non-directional homogeneity to examine positive and negative joint effects of metal mixture components. Metal concentrations are divided into 4 quantiles to estimate odd ratios (ORs).Results: Compared to those without incident cognitive impairment under ECB tests, the odds of having incident cognitive impairment was reduced by 30% [OR (95% CI) = 0.70 (0.45, 1.10)], but the association between metal mixture and primary outcome was not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.12. Among the five metals, Ca and Cd contributed positive joint effect (scaled effect size = 0.31), whereas Mg, Zn and As contributed negative joint effect (scaled effect size = -0.67).Conclusion: Findings suggest that calcium and cadmium may be harmful to cognitive function, and magnesium, zinc, and arsenic may be beneficial to cognitive health.</p>

<p><strong><em>Environmental exposure to heavy metal contaminants: Optimizing spectrometer calibration via least squares and mixed model methods</em></strong></p>
<p>Environmental exposure to heavy metal contaminants advances disease and mortality processes associated with cardiovascular disease. Effective biomarker measurement depends on lab-based spectrometers calibrated on standardized concentrations of geochemical elements. Calibration regresses a net signal on a standard concentration to understand the relationship between these; subsequently, this relationship is used to estimate concentrations based on samples reflecting environmental exposures. In this project, regression techniques for optimizing instrument calibration were compared for robustness,variability, and linearity. Various model specifications for least squares (OLS and GLS) and linear mixed models (LMM) were conducted on 1472 standard concentrations and their measured net signals; these data are nested in 16 elements with 12 calibration runs each. OLS results demonstrate lower measurement variability and strong linearity under instrument calibration paradigms where regressions are supplied with more standardized concentration values near the low limit of detection (LOD).Additionally, LMM analysis shows an identity relationship with OLS-estimated slopes, such that per-calibration-run OLS estimation is comparable to cross-run population-average corrected random effects, and OLS regression does not over fit to within-run error variance. Taken together, our results suggest linear extrapolation using calibration run specific OLS estimates with or without forcing the regression through the origin is a valid approach; additional calibration runs and associated data analyses suggest this can also be used to expand measurements below the previous limit of detection for this sample.</p>

<p><strong><em>Levels of inorganic and total arsenic measured in rice and water associated with urine arsenic</em></strong></p>
<p>Arsenic has toxicity to several organ system, and this contaminant is prevalent in the environment, making it particularly important for accurate characterization of arsenic exposure.Our aim is to examine how levels of inorganic and total arsenic in rice and water correlate with urine arsenic, and to fully describe how each contributes to aggregate arsenic exposure both individually and collectively.We used heatmap to show the correlations between water, raw rice, cooked rice and urine in both speciated data set and non-speciated data set. We applied B-spline regression model to find the inflection point (interval) that water arsenic changes the level of raw rice arsenic, and linear regression model to find biomarker of rice arsenic using urinary arsenic for future prediction.Correlation study shows that inorganic arsenic levels in rice were strongly influenced by arsenic levels in cooking water. Infection point study indicates that, when water with arsenic level is higher than 25 g/Lis used to cook the raw rice,the cooked rice has higher arsenic level than its raw form, vice versa. Considering the lack of epidemiologic studies linking arsenic levels in food to adverse health outcomes, we will next explore whether arsenic levels in rice are linked to adverse health outcomes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Objective and Subjective Neighborhood Crime Associated with Poor Sleep Among Young Sexual Minority Men: A GPS Study </em></strong></p>
<p>Sleep disparities in sexual minority male(SMM) populations have received relatively little attention but they may be critical to explaining other health disparities seen among SMM, via neural or hormonal pathways. Recent research suggests that crime may be a psychosocial stressor that contributes to sleep disparities but that finding has been based on subjective measures of crime. We conducted the P18 cohort study of 250 SMM in New York City, including 211 with GPS tracking data. We used the GPS tracking data to define daily path area activity spaces and tested the associations of violent crime in those activity spaces and in the subject’s residential neighborhood, perceived neighborhood safety and witnessing crime with a subjective measure of sleep. Using quasi-Poisson regression, adjusted for individual and neighborhood socioeconomic status, we found that SMM who witnessed more types of crime experienced significantly more nights of poor sleep over the course of a month (RR: 1.16, 95%CI: 1.05 – 1.27, p-value: &lt;0.01). We did not find any associations between violent crime rates in either the activity area or residential area and sleep. Our findings support the conclusion that personal exposure to crime is associated with sleep problems and provide further evidence for the pathway between stress and sleep. The lack of association between neighborhood crime levels and sleep suggests that there must be personal experience with crime and ambient presence is insufficient to produce an effect.</p>

<p><strong><em>Asthma Disproportionately Burden Minority Children</em></strong></p>
<p>Asthma is disproportionately prevalent among urban minority children in the United States, particularly low-income African American and Hispanic children living in inner cities such as the Bronx, New York. In these places, asthma hospitalization rates are nearly five times those in the rest of the country, and asthma death rates are roughly three times those in the rest of the country. The prevalence of asthma among youngsters in some Bronx communities has reached to 20% to 25%. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has developed rigorous and comprehensive preventative asthma care guidelines. However, there are gaps and hurdles to implementing these standards at four distinct levels: the health care system, the practice, the provider, and the patient. One of the study’s key objectives is to investigate whether consistent use of eMPI (a provider-based intervention) results in both short- and long-term improvements in clinical outcomes. To do this, the researcher will undertake a two-group cluster randomization study using the intent-to-treat principle to compare eMPI to enhanced usual care in 22 Bronx practices serving a total of 10,000 children with asthma. The outcome “number of symptom-free days within 14 days” will be summarized graphically and numerically at five time points: baseline, three-months, six-months, nine-months, and twelve-months follow-ups. The t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and chi-square tests will be used to examine whether there are baseline differences in demographic and background characteristics between eMPI intervention and usual care providers and patients when adjusted for clustering issues using GEE methodologies. Due to the significant proportion of missing data, mean imputation and multiple imputation approaches will be used to examine all participants.</p>

<p>A critical dimension of how food insecurity and nutrition affect the health of New Yorkers is food access, determined in large part by the neighborhood food environment. The long-term goal of this study is to identify how gentrification affects health outcomes of New Yorkers through patterns of supermarket transition (greenlining) and access to affordable, healthy foods. To do so, we need longitudinal data on the shifting food retail environment of the city. This project aims to use machine learning to train an algorithm to identify and categorize types of food retailers (supermarket, fast-food restaurant etc.) in order to explore differences between neighborhoods at different stages of gentrification.</p>

<p><strong><em>The AxialNet Autoencoder: Performing Group rs-fMRI using Nonlinear Feature ICA</em></strong></p>
<p>Independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular technique to un-cover functional networks from resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rsfMRI) data. In most ICA procedures, the observed signals are assumed to be a linear combination of independent sources. We propose AxialNet-ICA, a novel deep learning procedure for identifying spatially independent maps. Axi-alNet-ICA expands on traditional group-ICA by first encoding each 3D volume of the fMRI time series with a deep learning architecture informed by the image acquisition process. In addition, sources are separated from the nonlinear latent transformation of input data using FastICA, and a novel algorithm for decoding the maps using a reference component back into the original image space is pro-posed. When applying the AxialNet-ICA procedure to rsfMRI data from adolescent participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ (ABCD) studydataset, the deep learning procedure successfully identifies resting state networks such as the Frontoparietal network.</p>

<p><strong><em>Patient lifetime value evaluation</em></strong></p>
<p>During the practicum, I played a role as patient demographic analyst and revenue statistician in a dermatology clinic and was responsible for doing statistical analysis of patient demographics and company revenue. My main duty was to build machine learning model to predict the lifetime value of each patient. Meanwhile, I was also helping CFO with the company finance analysis. I used python to build a neural network model for the lifetime value prediction and Rstudio to do daily statistical analysis. In the end, I found that there were some significant indicators like distance to the clinic, whether there was reputable dermatologist nearby and the severity of skin problems. Knowing these information is important to the companies because it helps companies to know what they should target to and how they could make more revenue. One of the take home message I learned from the experience was that we should data wrangling and cleaning always take much more time than you expect. In school, all data was prepared and it took us little time to clean it and it took us more time to analyze it. However, in real world, original data is complex and messy. It will cost tons of time to do the preparation before we actually start statistical work.</p>

<p><strong><em>Machine Learning Methods Applied to Survival Predictions</em></strong></p>
<p>Machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool to make predictions for large amounts of data, but applying such methods in the context of survival data is still relatively new and requires some adaptations to account for the data from censored patients. Thus, advancing more knowledge in this field is important because more accurate applications of machine learning methods in the survival context would enable better survival predictions for all patients around the world. In the project, machine learning methods were applied on lung cancer patients’ data from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER). More specifically, the data were analyzed with some survival analysis methods such as the Cox hazards model and Kaplan-Meier estimator, and with machine learning algorithms such as a survival tree, bagging survival trees, and random forest. From these analyses, it was found that male patients are generally expected to show slightly lower survival probability than female patients across all time points and that some of the most important factors in predicting the survival probability of these lung cancer patients are stage of cancer, age of patient, tumor size, and histologic type of the cancer. In addition, the results showed that the predicted survival curves obtained by the machine learning methods on the survival data are similar to the Kaplan-Meier curves. However, because there are still gaps in the available information, it would be crucial for more machine learning methods to be applied to survival data.</p>

<p><strong><em>Assessing Assay Stability, and Feasibility of Using Internal Data Source</em></strong></p>
<p>Siemens manufactures in vitro diagnostic tests that use body samples like serum, plasma, and urine. The reagent is the solution used to detect the analytes in the samples. Siemens produces reagents for a wide variety of assays; tests that detect markers for a variety of biomarkers and diseases.The physical reagents used in testing can degrade over time which can impact the accuracy of patient results. The study aims to determine which assays are degrading over time, by how much, and if environmental factors like temperature impact the stability. The study also aims to determine if it is feasible to replace internally collected data with externally collected data for the purpose of monitoring the behavior of assays going forward. This study shows that external data that is automatically collected,in general,for most assays can provide more reliable data than internal studies.Assays 1 and 2 appear to be stable. Assay 3 does not appear to be stable. Assay 4 has stability issues, but it is very lot to lot dependent. Assays 2 and 4 show patterns in stability based on run temperature,however,the patterns are based not only on run temperature but also average dose level being tested.</p>

<p>Teen pregnancy and early marriage are issues that influence human rights and reproductive health and lead to social problems. The median age at marriage for women aged 25-49 in Uganda is around 18. Early marriage problems in Uganda and its rural area such as Rakai has been studied these years and those early pregnancy conditions have been improved in the last three decades. In this report, we use data from both Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), comparing indicators they share, and aim to explore trends on pregnancy index, teen marriage proportion, and factors influencing sexual behaviors from 1988-2019. The changes in some variables in the two datasets are similar, and the period 1994-2000 is worth further exploring as it is abnormal. Child marriage proportion changes in two datasets have huge discrepancies are due to the method of questionnaire inquiry should also be noted.</p>

<p><strong><em>Sampling and Weighting Strategies for Imperfect Sampling Frames in Cluster Sampling</em></strong></p>
<p>The Uganda Refugee Population-based HIV Impact Assessment Survey (RUPHIA) is a cross-sectional household-based survey that assesses the prevalence of key Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-related health indicators in a sample of the Ugandan refugee population. In RUPHIA, since there was no up-to-date sampling frame containing accurate locations and population data of refugee neighborhoods, the GridEZ algorithm was used to generate a sampling frame of refugee enumeration zones (EZs) with gridded population estimates. Forty EZs were selected from the gridded sampling frame using probability proportional to size sampling with the gridded population estimates as the size variable, and a maximum of 35 households (HHs) were selected from each selected EZ. Although the gridded sampling has gained a lot of popularity in recent years, it has two major limitations. First, not all EZs in the sampling frame are eligible. Three of the originally-selected EZs were not refugee neighborhoods and thus needed to be excluded or replaced. Second, the gridded population estimates may not be an accurate measure of the true population sizes, yielding highly variable HH weights. To evaluate the impact of the imperfect gridded sampling frame, we conducted a comprehensive simulation study with artificial data mimicking the RUPHIA sample. We compared sampling and weighting strategies for estimating population means and totals, with or without excluding ineligible EZs from the frame before sampling, with or without access to the true population sizes of EZs in the sampling, and excluding or replacing ineligible EZs with the next eligible EZ on the frame. We also compared two different weighting approaches when replacement is used for ineligible EZs. We found that the inaccurate measures of true EZ sizes introduced more bias and uncertainty in the survey quantities estimation than the ineligible EZs in the frame. Further, our simulations showed that the adjustment to the selection probability for the replacement EZs is important and can reduce bias in the survey estimation. The findings of the simulation have been used to guide the sampling and weighting decisions in the RUPHIA survey.</p>

<p>Viral load suppression is associated with decreased HIV transmission and enhanced survival of HIV+ individuals. We assessed characteristics associated with unsuppressed viral load and viral failure in adults living with HIV(ALWH) (15-59 years) using Population-based HIV Impact Assessment (PHIA) surveys(2015-2019). Consenting adults from randomly selected households in 10 African countries provided demographic and clinical information and whole blood for household HIV testing.Household HIV+ results were laboratory-confirmed. Unsuppressed viral load (UVL) was defined as &gt;1000 copies/ml, non-adherence as missed ARV doses for &gt; one day in the past month. Most commonly prescribed first-and second-line ARVs, i.e., efavirenz, nevirapine, tenofovir, atazanavir, and lopinavir,were assayed in dried blood spots. Variances were estimated via Taylor series linearization. Controlling for demographic covariates, participants were significantly more likely to have VL suppression older age, female sex, more education, optimal ART adherence, did not switch to second-line ART,having married,and did not reside in Zimbabwe and Cameroon.Adjusting for demographic characteristics, younger age, living in urban areas,being married, and lower level education were associated with lower odds for switching to second line ARV We found low UVL prevalence among those on ART for more than one year in the ten African countries. Better monitoring of those on treatment may further reduce UVL prevalence.</p>

<p><strong><em>Effect of NewYork-Presbyterian’s order renewal policy on incidence of CAUTI and catheter dwell time</em></strong></p>
<p>Catheter-associated urinary tract infection(CAUTI)is a common infection in hospital patients who have to receive the insertion of Indwelling Urethral Catheterization (IUC) due to medical reasons. Catheter scan offer an opportunity for urethral organisms to enter the bladder. The dwell time of catheter is now considered the most important factor in the incidence of CAUTI. NewYork-Presbyterian has been experimenting with a new policy of compulsory order renewal to test if checking on patients with catheters frequently will help shorten the dwell time of IUC and decrease the incidence of CAUTI. The IUC dwell time is not significantly different between experiment and control group, but it has a significant decreasing trend after the conduction of compulsory order renewal policy. For CAUTI incidence rate, experiment group has a significantly smaller rate than historical group. Over time, the incidence rate dropped after conduction of the policy but rise since 2021-11. After the conduction of the policy, the CAUTI incidence rate was smaller but the result was not significant.</p>

<p><strong><em>A Study of Moderator Effects by Physical Illness and Protective Factors on Suicidal Ideation in Late-life Depression</em></strong></p>
<p>The main goal for this practicum project was to explore interaction effects by selected variables on suicidal ideation in late life, which could help to better understand the role of risk factors and protective factors, and to improve treatments for those at risk.The analysis was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a longitudinal study about late-life depression. There was a total of 337 subjects: 67 subjects as healthy controls, 164 depressed subjects without suicide attempts, and 106 depressed subjects having suicide attempts. The main outcome (dependent) variable of interest was suicidal ideation scores of subjects at the baseline;secondary outcome was history of suicide attempt in the 2 years prior to baseline. The risk factors of interest were depression severity scores and physical illness total score, while the moderator variable was pre-standardized protective factors; covariates were age at the baseline, gender.We used ZIP model as the primary analysis method and Tobit model as the secondary.5-fold cross-validation for 10 times was used to compare the performance in handling zero-inflated outcomes between two models. Logistic regression model was exploited for the analysis of secondary outcome. In the ZIP model, there was a significant moderation of depression severity’s effect on suicidal ideation by the protective factor. Strong protective factors were able to alleviate the incidence of having suicidal ideation for subjects as their depression severity scores increased, however, weak protective factors barely showed the moderation effect on the odds of current suicidal ideation. A strong trend level of interaction between depression severity and physical illness, showing that high physical illness scores had an aggravation impact on both the odds and expected counts of suicidal ideation as depression severity scores increased. Additionally, the protective factors had a strong trend level of interaction effect with physical illness on suicidal ideation. Strong protective factors would decrease both the odds and expected counts of suicidal ideation as physical illness became more severe.A moderation with much more significance of depression severity’s effect on suicidal ideation by physical illness was obtained from Tobit model than ZIP model. Even though that, ZIP model showed lower average cross-validation error than Tobit model due to different assumptions on the mechanism of zero-inflated part, and ZIP model was more suitable because zero part was fully observed for the outcome. Furthermore,we noticed a significant moderation of depression severity’s effect against the odds of recent suicide attempts within two years, showed that as depression severity scores increased, subjects are in favor of having recent suicide attempt within two years when they had high physical illness score</p>

<p><strong><em>Anxiety and Depression Symptoms Among Healthcare and Essential Workers During Covid: Longitudinal Analysis</em></strong></p>
<p>Background:Despite relevant risk of psychopathology originating from COVID-19 related stress, many healthcare and essential workers avoid mental health care.It is unknown how mental health has changed among those workers in the US during COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the long-term difference of anxiety and depression over 90 days when healthcare and essential workers working exposed to COVID-19 and compare the mental health trend by their vaccination status and covid test result.Methods:In this longitudinal observational study, 2734 essential workers and 1402 healthcare workers completed online surveys in August2021and90 days later(November 2021). The survey included their information on anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder assessment)and depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire), vaccine status, and covid test results.Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM)were used to analyze differences in anxiety and depression symptoms across time by demographic and COVID related variables.Results:Sixty-one percent of participants (n=2533) had follow-up measure at 90 days and no missing values. The average anxiety score at baseline was 8.09 (SD=5.74, range 0-21), and the average depression score was 8.44 (SD=6.46, range 0-27).These average values represented mild depression and anxiety level. Both anxiety and depression levels declined at 90 days (b=-0.65, SE=0.09, p&lt;.0001 for anxiety; b=-0.14, SE=0.10, p=0.1488 for depression symptoms). Being a woman, an essential worker, at a younger age, having vaccinated were all risk factors for higher anxiety and depression at baseline.Compared to vaccinated group, least-square means for anxiety and depression score of non-vaccinated group decreased more at90 days(Anxiety: d=-0.78, SE=0.23, p=0.0006 for non-vaccinated; d=-0.61, SE=0.10, p&lt;.0001 for vaccinated; Depression: d=-0.49. SE=0.25, p=0.05 for non-vaccinated; d=-0.07, SE=0.11, p=0.53 for vaccinated). There was no significant difference in anxiety and depression between covid test results.Conclusion:The results suggest that a higher level of depression and anxiety occurred at baseline and slightly declined 90 days later, possibly because workers gradually adapted to working circumstances. It is surprising that taking vaccine could not provide relief but increased anxiety and depression levels. Hence, the mental health problem of healthcare and essential workers still needs society’s attention.</p>

<p><strong><em>Potential association between serum selenium level and incident cognitive impairment</em></strong></p>
<p>Introduction Cognitive function is one aspect of overall brain health that affects the ability of humans to perform daily tasks. Because of the lack of therapeutic treatment, the focus has been shifting towards primary prevention of early cognitive impairment and as a result, the identification of risk factors that associated with declining cognitive function.Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient necessary for proper functioning of human. It has been shown to protect against cell damage and inflammations as well as being involved in metabolism of thyroid hormones. Furthermore, some studies have shown that patients with Alzheimer’s disease have lower level of Se, indicating a correlation between a diet rich in Se with lower risk of this degenerative disease. However, either too high or too low level of Se have been observed to be somewhat harmful to human health. The most commonly used indicator of selenium is its serum concentration, which is estimated between 6-12 ug/L. Animal protein is a good source of selenium, so are seafood, organ meats, and Brazil nuts. Few studies have been conducted on serum Se level and the effect it has or lack thereof on cognitive function. There was only one cross-sectional study -by Cardoso et al. (2018) -that claims no association was found between Se and cognitive performance, based on data of 154 Australians 60 years old and above which is of limited and not representative sample size. Thus, this study aims to examine the association between serum Se level and incident cognitive impairment using data from the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. Methods Important covariates were included in the models are age, gender, race (Black or White), region (Stroke Buckle, Stroke Belt, or non-Stroke-Belt), education level (&lt; high school, high school graduate, some college, or college graduate), income group (&lt;20K, 20-34K, 35-74K, &gt;= 75K), urban group (rural, mixed, urban), smoke (never, past, current), alcohol (none, moderate, heavy), physical activity (none, 1-3 times per week, 4 or more per week), BMI group (normal, overweight, obese), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, hypertension (yes or no), history of heart disease (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, insulin,c-reactive protein, Med diet score, intake of fish oil. Outcome is incident impairment on the Six-Item Screener (SIS) or impairment on the Enhanced Cognitive Battery (ECB) assessments. Baseline characteristic of the study population were summarized in Table 1 using mean values with standard deviations for continuous variables and proportions for categorical variables. Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis tests, or Chi-squared tests were used to compare across serum Se levels using the first level as reference.Logistic regression was used to examine the association between serum Se levels and outcome (SIS/ECB). Model 1 was adjusted for race, gender, urban/rural. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for income, education, smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, and body mass index. Model 3 was further adjusted for hypertension, CESD (depression), HDL/LDL ratio, C-reactive protein. Finally, model 4 was additionally adjusted for AsCr. Linear trends were tested by using the continuous variable of the exposure with values below 5th percentile or higher than 95th percentile excluded.P values equal or less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Of the 2270 observations, 55 reported impaired on ECB and 512 missing values and the rest reported no impairment on ECB. Regarding SIS outcome, 200 reported impaired and the rest have no impairment. The baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. The mean participant age at baseline was 64 years (standard deviation 9 years) with 55% woman and 38% black. Participants with higher Se level were more likely to be White and reportedly have higher level of education and income. Both models did not find a statistically significant linear relationship between Se levels and the log odds of developing cognitive impairment. However, people in the higher tertile seems to have higher risk of having cognitive impairment compared to people in the lower tertile</p>

<p><strong><em>Detail analysis of Emotional Stroop Cognitive task in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) Global study</em></strong></p>
<p>In this global study, we used two stroop tasks to investigate the effect of task irrelevant emotional distractors on attentional proactive control and its interaction with covariates such as sites, sex and pictures. 229 patients with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) from Brazil, India, the Netherlands, South Africa, and the USA were included to conduct 144 trails. There were 6 conditions of trials: 2 valences (Negative/Washing vs. Neutral) by 3 congruencies (Incongruent vs. neutral vs. congruent). We analyzed the accuracy rate by groups. Mean reaction times were calculated to compare the difference of different groups and linear regression was used to control covariates. We also derived 2 outcomes from reaction time: Interference effect (incongruent – neutral) and Facilitation effect (neutral –congruent). Generally, we found negative stimuli can prolong the reaction time of patients. Interference and facilitation were different for different sex and sites. Negative pictures also had an effect on the reaction time</p>

<p><strong><em>GWAS General Linear Mixed Model Fine-Mapping Exploration for Alzheimer’s Disease Causal Variants Using SusieR Package</em></strong></p>
<p>Alzheimer’s Disease has been a long-standing chronic disease suffering tens of millions elder lies worldwide. However, the cause and cure is still a development in progress. In particular, linkage disequilibrium (LD) has been the key issue of identifying the causal variants of such disease.This paper contains the potential solutions to such problems with the General Linear Mixed Model Fine-Mapping tool exploration. Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) is a general observational study to identify if certain genetic variants are associated with specific disease traits. Fine-mapping then takes place to determine the causal variants of the disease. However,the often highly correlated variants and sparse effects have posted difficulties to this process.Numerous tools have developed to overcome these difficulties, of which SuSiER is one of them.SuSiER (Sum of Single Effects Regression), developed by Gao Wang at el., utilizes a vector of regression coefficients for a sum of single effect vector for the model. With simulated datasets mimicking the human genome of binary phenotypes for case-control study, model fitting and predictions are compared between linear regression, SuSiE Regression, and logistic regression.Of which, SuSiER have shown substantial better performance and efficiencies.</p>

<p><strong><em>Identify Longitudinal Sub-phenotypes of COVID-19 Patients using Hidden Markov Model </em></strong></p>
<p>Identifying sub-phenotypes of COVID patients has been critical for clinicians to perform risk stratification and provide appropriate therapy for patients who are more likely to develop into mechanical intubation. We proposed a longitudinal clustering method to cover the change of Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in whole hospitalization periods of 656 hospitalized COVID patients. Hidden Markov model was applied to convert each SOFA score trajectory into probability density and the distance between trajectories is estimated as KL-divergence in distance matrix. Partitioning around medoids (PAM) clustering discover 2 clusters from the distance matrix, with n = 200 and 456 respectively. The smaller cluster containing 200 patients has significantly higher SOFA score and much higher death rate and ventilation rate than the other during the whole period, which indicates the identification of cluster that a patient belongs to may indicate the severity of COVID he/she will have. With longitudinal cluster discovered, we plan to complete post-cluster analysis and expand the model to another large dataset to increase generalizability.</p>

<p><strong><em>Investigation of COVID-19 Vaccination Among Nursing Home Residents</em></strong></p>
<p>Investigating specifically about the nursing homes’ characteristics related to their COVID-19 situations, this practicum project constructed a provider extraction program, and used it to extract provider information and conduct statistical analysis. The provider extraction program combines COVID-19 related variables and variables from Medicare/Medicaid record. Using these variables, descriptive and formal analysis are performed to search for important nursing home characteristics that may be associated with low vaccination rates. Some important findings include the nursing home characteristics: ownership type and rating may be important factors affecting the COVID-19 vaccination rates. The result is important for the healthcare system to improve the nursing homes with specific targets and should be useful for helping people to filter nursing homes that match their expectations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Do neighborhood disparities in COVID Outcomes still existed in New York City two years into the pandemic?</em></strong></p>
<p>Neighborhoods with higher percentage of racial/ethnic minorities and lower socioeconomic groups were unequally affected by COVID in NYC in the initial stage of COVID outbreak, but it is unclear if the disparities still existed two years into the pandemic. In order to assess this, we used demographic and socioeconomic data along with case and death count data obtained for NYC at neighborhood level to assess the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes between August 1, 2021 and February 28, 2022 –divided into two waves: wave 3(Delta variant; 08/01/21-11/31/21)and wave 4(omicron variant; 12/1/22-2/28/22). This was done using Bayesian hierarchical spatial negative binomial model to fit marginal and multivariable models. The outcomes were modeled as incidence rates for the case count and for death count, the outcomes were modeled as case fatality rate and death rate per capita. The results from the study showed that wave 4 had much higher cumulative case counts than wave 3 but a lower cumulative death count than wave 3and neighborhoods that were hardly hit in early waves were also more affected in later waves. The study also showed that compared to Manhattan, neighborhoods in Staten Island had higher incidence rate and death rate per capita in both wave3 and wave 4;neighborhoods in Brooklyn had higher death rate per capita and case fatality ratio in both waves;and neighborhoods in Queens had elevated death rate per capita in both waves. Neighborhoods with higher percentage of seniors (≥75 years) had lower incidence rate but higher case fatality ratio and death rate per capita in both waves. In wave 3, neighborhoods with higher percentage of minorities had slightly lower incidence rate, but neighborhoods with more Hispanic population were found to have higher death rate per capita and case fatality ratio and neighborhoods with more Black population also had elevated level of case fatality ratio. There were no racial/ethnic disparities in wave 4. Similar to the previous two waves, neighborhood median house income continued to be negatively associated with all three COVID outcomes in both wave 3 and wave 4. Our study suggested that neighborhood disparities in COVID outcomes still existed in NYC two years into the pandemic. We believe that knowledge and understanding of demographic disparities as it relates to COVID outcomes may help in formulating better public health practices, crisis planning, and health policies that take into account the effect of said disparities</p>

<p><strong><em>Neighborhood Trajectories and Risk Factors of COVID outcomes in NYC from 2020 to 2022</em></strong></p>
<p>Since the confirmation of the first COVID-19 case in NYC in March 2020, NYC has gone through four major waves of coronavirus outbreak (Wave 1: 03/20-05/20;Wave 2: 12/20-04/21;Wave 3: 08/21-12/21; Wave 4: 12/21-02/22). Although several studies have been conducted to assess the associations between neighborhood characteristics and COVID outcomes, few have examined the longitudinal trajectories across four waves and the associated risk factors. In this practicum project, we use total counts of confirmed positive cases and deaths in each wave in each of the 177 NYC neighborhoods as outcomes, and examine neighborhood demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with COVID incidence rate per capita and death rate per capita. To visualize the data, we plot the overall trajectories of COVID outcomes and stratify by neighborhood characteristics and zip codes. Then we use growth mixture models to identify latent classes of trajectories over time, and assess neighborhood factors associated with the latent classes using Bayesian multinomial logistic regression models.Our analysis shows that the incidence rate experiences a peak in Wave 2, undergoes a dropping trend in Wave 3 and increases dramatically in Wave 4.Conversely, overall death rate has a continuous decreasing trend across the four waves. For both incidence rate and death rate trajectories, 4 latent classes are identified using growth mixture models among 177 NYC neighborhoods, and different classes have great separations in the COVID outcomes. For death rate, the highest class is three times of the lowest class, and two middle classes are relatively high in the first two waves. The multinomial models show that neighborhoods with higher percentage of Black and Hispanic population, higher percentage of senior, and lower median household income are more likely to be in the highest death rate class.In conclusion, great disparities exist in the COVID outcomes trajectories between NYC neighborhoods. People in socioeconomic disadvantage groups are more likely to have poorer covid outcomes across four wave</p>

<p><strong><em>Prediction of AMRO infections during COVID-19 pandemic</em></strong></p>
<p>Patients treated with antibiotics are at increased risk of antimicrobial resistance infection (AMRO), especially during the covid-19 pandemic. The study is to identify the risk factors of AMRO infection and predict how they associate with different types of bacterial/fungal infections in a cohort study. Adult patients hospitalized and did antimicrobial resistance tests between 2 March and 31 May 2020 were evaluated. Data were extracted from administrative records and medical records, including diagnoses, laboratory test results, antibiotic use. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate risk factors of AMRO infection. Final prediction models were estimated through case-control analysis and bootstrap smoothing procedure. Potential interactions, confounding effects, and covariability were also checked. Generally, sex, the duration of hospital stays, and covid were associated with AMRO infections. However, each type of antibiotic has its model and positive or negative relationship with these risk factors. Although AMRO infections occur in a small proportion of patients, they are more prevalent with prolonged hospital stays and covid positive patients. Antimicrobial stewardship is imperative and necessary to minimize unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic use, and antimicrobials must be limited to suspected or confirmed bacterial infections.</p>
