***Associations Between Dystrophin Genotype, Time of Data Entry, and Ambulatory Outcomes in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD***

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive loss of muscle andcaused by mutationsin thedystrophin gene which encodes for a specific muscle repairing protein. Thereare limited treatment options available with very minimal effect for DMD. Whereasthere are many ongoing studies aiming to find effective therapeutic approaches forthe disease, this paper focuses on the statistical aspects of DMD, in hopes to bring more information onthe ambulatory outcomes which can serve as an indicator of thedisease progression,and its potential associations with dystrophin genotypes and the time of patients entering the study. This study uses the natural history database for DMD patients across the global, conducts Kaplan-Meier estimating and constructs accelerated failure time(AFT) modelswith time-varying variable (time of patient data entry). For the results, there is a significant association between the dystrophin genotype and the ambulatory outcomes, controlling for the data sources. Future research direction includes sensitivity analyses on data missingness as well as fitting different survival models other than the AFT models.

***The identification of differential expression and quantitative trait loci for alternative polyadenylation among three brain regions***

Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is emerging as a widespread mechanism used to control gene expression.  As  elaborated  by  Li  (2021),  Quantitative  trait  loci  (QTL)  regulating  3’-UTR Alternative polyadenylation provides an atlas for interpreting the regulatory role of  non-coding variants in human disease. This cross-sectional investigation studied the association between non-coding variation located near 3’UTR (3’aQTL) and Alzheimer's Disease (AD) through APA regulations.  Using  429  individuals  from  the  ROSMAP  study  (Religious  Orders  Study/Memory and Aging Project), we seek to elucidate the brain specific quantitative trait loci regulator of APA usage,  to  compare  the  usage  between  case  and  control  groups  to  detect  differential  expression genes  among  three  brain  regions  (DLPFC,  AC,  and  PCC),  to  consolidate  and  explore  the mechanism of GWAS fine-mapped signals with aQTL signals. To investigate these questions, we developed  a  bioinformatics  workflow  integrating  a  variety  of  state-of-the-art  computational techniques for multi-omics data analysis. Specifically, Daprs2 is utilized to call APA usage. The hidden confounders for phenotypes and covariates were constructed using PEER. Whole genome quantitative trait loci analysis was implemented based on tensorQTL. The differential expression analysis was based on Voom-limma which accounts for RNA data. The results show a series of significant leading risk genes including ZCWPW1, USP6NL, CCDC6, and APP, and the workflow is compatible in revealing novel risk variants in genes like TMEM106B, which was not previously detected  until  a  recent  study  (Wightman,  et.al.,  2021).  However,  emerging  biases  of  RNA sequencing  technique  were  not  removed  on  the  cDNA  fragment  level  such  that  additional  bias removal techniques may also need tobe investigated to gain a more accurate estimation of gene expression. In conclusion, it appears that Alternative polyadenylation usages differ between brain regions and it gives a good interpretation of the disease-related variants in the non-coding region. Further work could be done to further investigate the mechanism of APA usage, binding proteins, and gene expression.

***Integrative analysis of neurodevelopmental epigenomic features elucidates the role of non-coding regulatory DNA variations associated with neurodevelopmental disorder***

Introduction:Numerous variants associated with neurologicaldiseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) havebeen discovered. However, most of these variants are coding variants and the coding region of thegenome makes up only 1% of the entire genome. The effects of non-coding variants on the onset ofneurodegenerative diseases remain poorly understood.. A major challenge is a lack of functional genomicdata in tissue and cell types relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. Unlike data for tissues such asblood and various cell lines, brain tissue and cell samples are difficult to collect.Methods:We explored Convolutional Neural Networkmodels developed for predicting epigenomicfeatures in regulatory DNA regions, and extended them to create prediction models specific for  a largernumber of neurodevelopmental-related epigenomic features. These features were then assessed for theirfunctional role on variants and genes related to neurological diseases such as AD and IntellectualDisability (ID). Stratified LD Score Regression (S-LDSC) was used to compare the effectiveness of usingDeep Learning based annotations to experimentally determined features through enrichment ofNeurodevelopmental (ND) features in AD Variants to a set of control phenotype, such as variantsassociated with Age related Macular degeneration (AMD). For ID, the model’s usefulness was assessedby comparing a set of already established ID genes in family-based studies of their coding regions fortheir relative predicted functional importance in regulatory regions, against that of other non-ID genes.Results:The convolutional neural network based approachthat was used had an average ROC of 0.91and the average precision was 0.61 across all the features in our model. This result indicates that themodel has good accuracy and precision when generating predictions for the epigenomic features. In ourenrichment analysis we were able to determine that deep learning annotations provide a larger list ofreliable features, defined as features for which the enrichment calculation is significant (FDR-correctedp-value<0.01), when compared to the experimentally determined annotation data. This means that withdeep learning we would be able to utilize more annotations to inform downstream analyses such asfine-mapping which will result in better accuracy. When comparing S-LDSC enrichment results on AD toAMD using a two-sided Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test, we found a distinct benefit of utilizing features relevantto AD (including ND and immune system) as there was a significantly greater enrichment of ND-relatedfeatures in AD variants compared to other features (p-value < 2.2E-16) while there was no significantdifference between these two groups of features in AMD variants (p-value = 1). For ID genes, the modelpredicted 6/10 known ID Family genes to be 1st or 2nd most important within each family in ND-relatedfeatures when using a prediction window of 100KB around the TSS of the gene to capture contributions ofnon-coding DNA regions.Conclusions:We have found that neurodevelopmental-relatedepigenomic features can contribute to ourunderstanding of neurological disorders such as AD and ID. Using our enrichment results to help informfuture fine-mapping and aggregated rare variant association testing we may be able to elucidatenon-coding rare variants that can play a role in these diseases. Furthermore, more advanced and newermodels such as transfer learning could be helpful in getting even more accurate predictions for theseepigenomic features

***Association between telomere length (TL) change and trace elements levels***

Trace elements are regards as any chemical element that is present in the human body. Although they might be required in small amounts, they are essential for human body to maintain healthy condition, and lack of them could lead to nutritional deficiency.On the other hand, telomeres are an essential part of human cells that affect how people’scells age, so the change of its length often representsa hallmark for cell death and biological ageing. This study aims to find whether there is an association between telomere length (TL)changeand trace elementslevel, as well as other variables.Material and methods:The participants of this study were collected from a random sub-cohort (n=2666) from the REGARDS study. After adjusting inclusion and exclusion criteria, the final sample size is 592. Their telomere length iscalculating from peripheral blood mononuclear cells using quantitative polymerase chain reactions, and it is measured at baseline and the second visit.We firstly transform and normalized each trace element level, then conducting aprinciple component analysis tocategorizedthem into three groups.Multivariable regression analyses are used to examine if there is anysignificant exposure with telomere length change. Analyses also adjust for sex, race, region, education level and other covariates.Results:There are total eight trace elements analyzed. Ca, Mg, Se, Zn and Fe are categorized as PC1; Hg and As are categorized as PC2; Cd alone is categorized as PC3. The fraction ofvariance explainedby this categorizationbetween the variance of that principal component and the total varianceis 52%. After log-transforming and standardizing thetelomere length change, significant negative associations are found in PC2(Hg, As)levels with telomere length change during two measurements with each male participant(p= 0.040049, n=223)in adjusted models.Conclusionand recommendation:The finding suggestthat telomere length change isinversely associated with thelevels of Hg and As among male. We recommend increasing telomere length measurements to at least three measurement per participant to further explore any association.

***Genetic Susceptibility and Severity of COVID-19: a Genome-Wide Association Study***

Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 488million infections and 6 million deaths as of April 1st. Many previous studies indicated some risk factors of COVID-19 including elderly age, cancer, chronic lung diseases, heart diseases, diabetes, and obesity, etc.However, little was known for genetic susceptibility and severity of COVID-19. In order to explore the association between COVID-19 susceptibility and human genome,a genome-wide association study was done aimed at finding any genetic-level risk factors of this disease especially focusing on SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and HLA (human leukocyte antigen).Method:The casesare573 COVID-19 patients grouped by severity from Hospitals in Guangzhou City and Wuhan City. The controls are2000 health East-Asian people whose genome data was already availablein iCarbonX database. All cases’ blood specimen were deeply sequenced. GATK software was then used as a tool for SNP calling which filtered all SNP from the whole genome data. After basic quality control, a population analysis based on PCA dimension reductio and Random Forest Model was done to eliminate non-east Asian cases in sample.Finally, a chi-square test was used to select significant SNP comparing cases and controls.Result: Most significant SNPs were found inHLA region on Chromosome 6, while some were also found in Chromosome 19, 9 and 11. There were 13 non-HLA region SNP and 4 HLA alleles (C\*04:01, A\*11:02, A\*31:01 and C\*07:01) associated with the severity of the disease. Among the 13 non-HLA region SNP which associated with the severity, only 2 SNP hadlow heterogeneity while others did not show heterogeneity. Among the 4 HLA alleles associated with severity, only 1 allele (A*11:02) had high heterogeneity.

***Functionally informed fine-mapping identifies new potential causal gene loci for Alzheimer’s disease***

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive disease that affectsmemory and other important mental functions[1]which has influenced 5.8 million people in America.[2]Past genome-wide association studies have discoveredlots of genomic loci, such asthe famous APOE gene, that are associated with AD but there isstill alarge proportion of the genetic variance remainingunexplained.[3,4]A more powerful tool that could better distinguish and identify the causal variants is desired. Here, we used a polygenic functionally-informed fine-mapping method calledPolyFun to reproduce the work of three published papers[3,4,5]as well as fine-mapping on 1703 independent linkage disequilibrium genetic blocks[6]to seeif PolyFun has a better performance on identifying the causal variance and to discover any new significant gene loci that worth further exploration.The PolyFun provided annotation[7]which is for ~19 million UK Biobank imputed SNPs with MAF>0.1%, based on the baseline-LF 2.2.UKB annotationswas used as the input for PolyFun.This study shows that PolyFun has a non-inferior performance than the regular methods and we found several significant gene regions that haven’tbeenfound in any paper yet. We anticipate that the performance of PolyFun could be further improved by inputting more and better annotations.

***Identification of pleiotropy in genome-wide association study of genetic variants and phenotypes in UK biobank***

Motivation: Pleiotropy refers to   a  specific condition in   which a  single genetic variant can be  causal to more than one phenotype. However, it  is   usually hard to   identify genetic pleiotropy and phenotype causal relationships due to loads of   unmeasured confounders. In  this study, we were using Mendelian Randomization (MR) to identify certain genetic pleiotropy. Materials and methods: We used dataset from UK    Biobank as a source. Mainly, we were interested in gene jazf-1 and phenotypes including asthma and type II d iabetes. The raw data was trimmed to get   rid of   unwanted chromosome information and formatted as required so that we could apply an R package called GSMR (Generalized Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization) to analyze. Results: Analyze of   the data showed estimated effect of   the having jazf-1 variant on outcomes – asthma and type II diabetes is 0.43, which means there is   a weak correlation between our exposure and outcomes, with p-v alue threshold 0.01. Discussion and further direction: GSMR is   no    doubt a  powerful tool in   analyzing genetic pleiotropy. However, it  has limitations such as   it  can only account for    weak-to-moderate correlations among instruments. The project is still on process, and there will be more analysis including phenotypes such as waist circumference, other blood traits and so   on.

***Pathogenic burden of children with acute encephalitis syndrome in Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India***

Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a major public health enigma globally. AESis a febrile illness associated with high riskof coma and refractory seizureswithacuteonset of fever followed by mental confusion, disorientation, delirium, coma and/or onset of seizures in patients. Annual seasonal outbreaks of AESwith high case fatality, especially in children have been reported in many states of India for several years. As per the National Vector-borne Disease Control Program (NVBDCP), more than 80,000 cases of AES were reported from India with approximately 10,000 (12.5%) fatalities between 2010 and 2018.Although majority of AES cases are linked with several different viruses(JEV, Enterovirus, Dengue), bacteria(Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia), fungus, parasites(Toxoplasmagondii), spirochetes,etc., still >50% of AES case etiology remains unknown.We performed analysison 543 cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from 2015 (n=153), 2016 (n=148), 2017 (n=242) from children with AES of unknown etiology. We employed advance high throughput sequencing platforms (VirCapSeq-VERT and BacCapSeq) and high-densitypeptide microarrays. Using thesemethods,we could detect direct or indirect evidence of infection in 63% of previously tested negative AES cases.Of theseundiagnosedAES cases, 93/ 535 (18%) AES recovered cases and 36/ 223 (16.1%) AES fatal cases were found positive forRickettsia spp. orOrientia tsutsugamushi.Human Herpes Virus 1 (HHV-1)was found in significantly higher abundance in fatal cases comparedto recovered AES cases. Seven samples were positive for HIV.Other virusesfoundincludedEnterovirus, Hepatitis-B Virus, HSV1 and Human Parvovirus B4.High abundance of anelloviruses, GBV like viruses as well as co-infections with Hepatitis A Virus, Mumps Virus, andMeasles Virus Genotype D8 inthe CSF of patients indicates immunocompromised status of the patients.

***Medicaid Oral Health Coverage for Adults with Intellectual & Developmental Disabilities –A Fiscal Analysis***

The goal of this report is to solve the central question thatwhetherthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) should require state Medicaid agencies to implement Medicaid reimbursement and payment policies that promote access to dental care for adults with I/DD andcould that ultimately be a cost-effective option over the long termor not.This reportexamines the relationship between states’ Medicaid dental benefits and the receipt of basic dental care among adults with I/DD, the relationship between state waiver programs and receipt of dental care, and the estimated cost and potential savings of implementing basic dental Medicaid benefits in states that donot currently offer it.The mixed methods research approach included a comprehensive review of the literature; interviews and conversations with experts, through a stakeholder meeting and key informant interviews; a 50-state and DC questionnaire administered to state DD agency leaders; and analysis of Medicaid claims data provided through the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System (T-MSIS) by CMS.The report concludes with recommendations at the federal and state level, and suggestions for more research in key understudied areas. Theserecommendations include:Recommendation 1: Require state Medicaid programs to provide adult dental benefits for people with I/DD through federal legislative mandate. Recommendation 2: If a requirement for extensive dental benefits is not legislated at the federal level, states should add dental benefits to adults with I/DD to existing or new 1915(c), 1915(i) waivers, or 1115 demonstrations. 
Recommendation 3: Other barriers to oral health care must be addressed that could be funded through state Medicaid programs. Recommendation 4: Improved transparency about managed care organization (MCO) reimbursement rates is needed to identify cost-effective reimbursement rates for Medicaid dental providers who treat adults with I/DD. Recommendation 5: More research is needed to pinpoint clear procedures and policy recommendations that would reduce the need for receipt of dental care in hospital operating rooms and therefore expand access to operating room.

***The epidemiology of violent deaths in Chile, 2001-2018***

Our project aimedto describe the violent mortality rates trends in Chile between 2001 and 2018, its current spatial distribution and ecological level correlatesthrough a population-based study using publicly accessible data. We began calculating age-adjusted mortality rates per 100,000 persons for sex, age, intention, and mechanism of death. Next, we used simple linear regression to estimate time trends for sex and intention. We then employed Hierarchical Poisson analyses to model the spatial distribution across 345 municipalities—expressed as smoothed standardized mortality ratio—and the influence of six ecological level variables: population density, % of urban population, % poverty, maintained green areas measured in square meters per inhabitant, security staff per 100,000 people, and school attendance rate.The average rate of violent death in Chile (2001-2018) was 15.9 per 100,000 people. The average homicide rate was 4.6 and the average suicide rate was 11.3. Rates were higher for men than women (23.2 vs. 4.3, for total violent deaths, respectively). Suffocation was the most common mechanism of death for suicide (82.3%), and cut/pierce for homicide (43.1%), followed by firearm (33.2%). The age group with the most violent deaths across all intentions was persons aged 25-49. Violent deaths are trending downward in Chile across all categories except suicides by women, which has remainedstable over the years. Poverty rates and urban population were also positively associated with violent mortality rates. Although violence related deaths seem to be decreasing across the country, disparities across gender, age group, and geographic location may have continuing effects on mortality rates.

***Are male audiences more likely to become loyal followers to the content they adore?***

In one of the largest video sharing social platforms, the operation team detects an unusual activity in the fan’s growth trend among users, where users whose videos are watched mainly bymale audiences tend to develop relatively faster fan’s growth. Given the current social platforms also consist of a higher proportion of male users, it remains unclear whether videos that favor male’s interest in the current platforms tend to generate faster fan’s growth rate than videos that favor both gender’s interest or female’s interest. And if this is the case, should the operation teamc hange their strategy in promoting videos that attract a male’s audience? To understand this question, the aim of the current project is to understand whether the video’s audience gender ratio impacts fans’ growth rate. By utilizing SQL to query and aggregate data and by implementing K-means algorithm, the user's fans growth rate and their corresponding video’s audience gender ratio are grouped in two three distinct subgroups. Specifically, video data with high ratios in both female and male audiences are grouped with data with relatively higher fan’s growth rate, whereas videos that have similar levels of male and female audiences are grouped with relatively lower level of fan’s growth rate. Similar results are identified across different fans levels and video’s category. I believe the result is suggesting, similar to the male audience, thefemale audience also show characteristics in becoming followers to the content they adore , andthus tailoring the social platform’s environment to favor male users only might not be aninformed decision.

***The association of stress and pubertal timing in girls by migrant status, a cross-sectional, mixed-method study***

Girls who mature earlier than their on-time peers have a heighted risk of many adverse health outcomes. Using exploratory sequential mixed-method design, cross-sectional data,and survival analysis, we investigated the relationship between stress, DHEAS, and earlierthelarche in a British-Bangladeshi migrant study.Girls told us about stressors in their lives and provided saliva to measure DHEAS. We coded stress responses into a categorical stress type variable (physical, relationship, emotional, school, cultural, and communication stress). We used survival analysis to test the association between stress type and time to thelarche. We checked the assumptions of accelerated failure time (AFT) and proportional hazard models, and compared their results. We chose AFT Weibull regression modelas the final model.Physical, relationship, emotional, and communication stress were associated with earlier thelarche (Physical time ratios (TR): 0.87 (0.73, 1.04), Relationship TR: 0.95 (0.84, 1.07), Emotional TR: 0.97 (0.85, 1.12), Communication TR: 0.94 (0.80, 1.11)). The increase in DHEAS level was associated with earlier thelarche as well (TR: 0.95 (0.89, 1.03)).This study is unique in using mixed-methods to explore stress type and thelarcheal timing in that it identified sources of stress from the girls’ perspective and integrated it with hormonal and pubertal outcomes.

***The Translational Science of Complex Drugs and Drug:Devices***

According  to  GDUFA  II  Commitment  Letter,  a  complex  generic  drug  product generally means the following: 1. A product with a complex active ingredient/ a complex formulation/ a complex route of delivery/ a complex dosage form. 2.  Complex  drug-device  combination  products.  3.  Other  products  where complexity  or  uncertainty  concerning  the  approval  pathway  or  possible alternative  approaches  would  benefit  from  early  scientific  engagement. In the practicum, we intend to describe the characteristics that helped complex products to be popularin comparison to failed products. The complex product data  will  be filtered  from  “Orange  Book”,  a  list  of  drugs  and pharmaceuticals that the FDA has approved as both safe and effective, and “Purple Book”, online database that contains information about biological products licensed by the FDA under the Public Health Service Act. Then, we will identify different families of complex products by log transferred linear regression. Finally, we will compare different families of complex products and evaluate the characteristics by logistic regression. If our evaluation could guide the development of a popular complex product, both patients and sponsors will receive benefits. For patients, the complex products are easier to use, require fewer visits, and address previously unmet needs. For sponsors, the complex products attain patent protection and expand product pipeline.The result of logistic regression shows that significant predictors include ROA, RLD,  patent, and exclusivity. In  other  words,  ROA,  RLD,  patent,  and exclusivity are favorable development traits of complex products.

***Assessing the efficacy and safety of Immunotherapy Drug for NSCLC in an Interim Analysis***

Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers and leading cause of cancer related death across the world. Among lung cancer, 80-85% are non-small cell lung cancer. These forms of cancer are commonly found to be advanced at the time of diagnosis. Immunotherapy is a hopeful treatment that seeks to increase the median overall survival of metastatic survival. There current immunotherapy under investigation is Cemiplimab,developed and produced by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,that works to block the PD-1/PD-L1 mediated T cell inhibition within cancer cells. The current phase 3 study works to investigate the efficacy and safety of Cemiplimab in combination with chemotherapy. The student’srole was to produce listing, tables, and figures consisting of various descriptive statistics and statistical analysis for FDA submission andinterim analysis; this included some secondary objectives and determining the Quality of Life (QOL) over the course of the study. To examine the QOL differences between patients treated with Cemiplimab plus chemotherapy versuspatients treated withplacebo plus chemotherapy over time,we conducted a mixed model for repeated measures.Other duties included annotatingand checking theCRFs according to CDISC SDTM standard.

***Functional data analysis for occupation time curves from wearable devices***

Inexpensive wearable accelerometers generally provide massive, objective, and continuous measurements of real-time physical activity. These data have potentially exciting applications to physiological monitoring and health care delivery. Dr. Ian McKeague and Hsin-wen Chang proposed an inferential method for comparing treatments based on wearable device (outcome) data. Dr. Michio Hirano, a professor of neurology at Columbia University, wants to apply gene therapy for mitochondrial disease. 5000 children are born with the mitochondrial disease each year in the US. We aim to find a treatment effect of Dr. Hirano’s therapy using the proposed procedures. Data were collected from 12 patients with the mitochondrial disease before and after being treated using an accelerometer activPAL 4. We first proposed a median offset method that turns the noisy raw accelerometer data into reasonable sensor readings. We then defined the occupation time curve as the Lebesgue measure of the amount of time that is above a certain level. We programmed algorithms that transform 10 million+ rows of wearable device data into occupation time curves for each patient. We then used Dr. Ian McKeague and Hsin-wen Chang’s nonparametric inference framework to construct confidence bands and compare functional means.

***Knowledge-transfer learning with multi-label random forests for SOFC simultaneous fault diagnosis***

Traditional machine learning assume that all data must exhibit the same distribution. These algorithms are inapplicable to many actual working conditions. Moreover, a learning-based model for a target domain, which has extremely few labeled data available for supervised learning, cannot be established given that learning-based models require adequate labeled data for training. This study proposes a multi-label transfer learning framework to easily utilize accessible data in one domain to predict patterns and classes, which cannot be easily obtained from another domain. The proposed framework is used to address the problem of simultaneous fault diagnosis in solid oxide fuel cells systems. This framework primarily includes: the multi-label transfer learning framework and the random forest algorithm. Transfer learning is utilized to learn useful characteristics from a huge amount of single fault data, which are adequately collected, and then transfer parameters to the target task in a simultaneous fault domain, where only a few target data are available for training. Experimental result shows that the proposed framework can diagnose simultaneous solid oxide fuel cells system faults with high accuracy, requires a small number of training data, and exhibits low computational burden. Moreover, fault root causes can also be determined via variable importance evaluation.

***Artificial Intelligence to Predict the Individual Survival of Peritoneal Metastasis in Colorectal Cancer at Prognosis***

Overview: We have applied deep learning techniques to construct an artificial intelligent model that can automatically predict survival of colorectal cancer patients with peritoneal metastasis. It focused more on the prediction of individual patients that can help design personalized treatments. With the combination of deep learning and statistical methods, our study provided a new perspective while dealing with complex survival analysis. Abstract: Background:Peritoneal metastasis(PM)has been regarded as the terminal stage of colorectal cancer because of the poor prognosis of PM.We purposedto construct an AI model with clinic opathological parameters and demographic characteristic to predict the survival prognosis of PMpatients.Methods: Our model was constructed through modifying a classic neural network, which is consisted of five layers, with COX proportional hazards as loss function. It is able to predict the overall survival of each individual patient with features selected from clinic opathological parameters. Results and Conclusion: In the testing cohort, the deep learning model indicated that the c-index reached 0.76 and brier score had 0.20.Unlike traditional statistical analysis that obtained specific prognostic factors, the deep learning model is designed for and more accurate when predicting the prognosis for individual patients.It provided evidence for designing personalized treatments and assisted surgeon to choose between different treatments for patients.

***A preliminary analysis of Profamilia’s Electronic Health Record (EHR) data***

Introduction/Background Profamilia is a pioneer in sexual and reproductive health services in the Dominican Republic(DR).As a non-governmental organization funded back in 1966, Profamilia seeks to promote and educate people about the importance of family planning and to expand the access to contraceptive methods, especially for those in vulnerable communities that often have high poverty and teen pregnancy indexes.Because Profamilia have 7 static clinics across the country, 2 mobile-outreach clinics and 3 associated health facilities and a marketing program, there is a ton of data stored within the sales/invoice and electronic health record (EHR) that can be utilized to answer important questions. Learning about diagnostic patterns and looking at the service trends allow us to identify gaps in Profamilia’s services and thus help to inform clinic operation decisions. Methods To harness the hidden power within the EHR and invoice data,  a preliminary analysis is conductedon selective EHR data from 2017 to 2020 (over 740k records), with 3 main focus areas: 1)diagnostic patterns (i.e.,looking at the frequency of diagnoses based on the ICD10 system and at the distribution of diagnosis based on gender and age group), 2) trend analysis, 3) data Quality(i.e., assess the quality of the data within the EHR and highlight data needs for the future). All data analysis is generated using SAS software, Version 3.8 of SAS Studio for Microsoft Windows. First, descriptive analysis is performed for majority of the variables to havean overallidea of the distribution of the data (i.e., gender, age, ICD10 diagnoses, etc.). After, family planning patterns and long-term trends are examined to see if there are any changes in service utilization over thepastyears (especially in 2020 amongst the COVID-19 pandemic). During all steps of analysis, data quality problems and challenges encountered are noted to inform future improvements.ResultsAmong the 740k+ records, about 85% are for female clients and about 39% of our clients are 16-29 years old. There are a total of 2,718 distinct diseases from the EHR data, based on the International Classification of Diseases or commonly known as the ICD10 system. According to the data, the top five most common ICD10 diagnoses were obesity (23.9%), gynecological exam (22.48%), confirmed pregnancy (6.25%), acute vaginitis (4.8%), and hypertension (3.24%); however, this list differs by gender. In 2020, the number of clinical records dropped from 232K to 193K, a 16.7% drop. As for family planning practices, of the 222,391 unique customers identified from the EHR data from 2017-2020 (using unique CustomerIDs), 30.42% ever had sex, 27.33% are sexually active, and only 11.03%have used any family planning services. More specifically, among those who are sexually active, 37.17% uses any family planning services and among those who had sex before, 36.23% uses any family planning servic

***Geographical Distribution, Temporal Trend, and Seasonality : An Investigation of Skin Bleaching interest in the US***

The application of skin bleaching products to inhibit melanogenesis is a common practice within the African diaspora. Little is known about skin bleaching prevalence and surveillance in the United States given the lack of epidemiological research. Investigating spatial distributions of internet searches “Skin Bleaching” using Google trends data may serve as a proxy for estimating the magnitude and popularity of skin bleaching practices throughout the United States.Google trends data is a new sourceof big data that has many health base research benefits for surveillanceand predicting magnitude. However, methods for assessing such data source with the lack of epidemiological studies have yet to be well understood. The objectiveof our study is to compare the most popular Skin Bleaching queries i.e. (skin bleaching, skin lightening), both geospatially and temporally using relative search volume, trend,and seasonal strength in the US.We also aim to determine if associations with SES variables and Skin Bleaching RSV by state exist. We define high RSV as states that fall in the third quartile of Relative Search Volume.We analyzed search terms “skin bleaching” and “skin lightening” from current Google Trends data of relative search volume across the United States. A total of 80% and 81% of states reported RSV data related to search term “Skin Bleaching” and “Skin Lightening” respectively. High RSV states compared to the rest differed significantly in trend strength for both search terms. Using PCA,we observeclustering of groups relatives to RSV features. Wesee that clustering among these featuresdiffer from states with High RSV.Using a zero inflated linear regression model, totalRSV accompanied by trend and seasonal strength we find that the association between RSV and SES state level variables suggest that SES state variables can be significant in predicting RSV.Implications of these findings are discussed consideringgrowing public health concerns about the use of skin bleaching, and potential for advocacy and public health interventions to address the use of skin bleaching products.

***Predictors of HIV Health and Medical Care Outcomes in Young Adults with HIV***

Community Health Advisory & Information Network (CHAIN) study captures diverse characteristics of persons living with HIV in the New York city and the tri-state area, producing reports to address the health, social services, and various other needs of people living with HIV. An ongoing study, various reports generated by CHAIN ensure proper allocation of funds for HIV programs by the federal government.Current report focuses on young adults with HIV by analyzing predictors of their care and health outcomes, evaluated using random effects logistic regression for panel data and bivariate analysis. CHAIN data is also dichotomized between younger adults of 18 to 35 years of age and older adults of 36 to 55 years of age to compare differences in outcomes such as adherence to antiretroviral treatment, primary care and viral suppression.The report results ensure that government services and resources are granted where they are needed the most, by providing the necessary information to local and state health departments. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that the younger adults are less adherent to antiretroviral treatment as compared to older adults. Significant predictors of access to primary care in younger adults include incarceration status, income status, sexual behavior, access to mental health services, and self-efficacy score. Adherence to treatment is associated with food insecurity, drug use, and self-efficacyscore as some of the predictors. Meanwhile, the outcome of consistent care is negatively impacted by drug use status, sexual behavior, and income status. This report-outcomes are in support of prior literature findings on predictors of HIV health and care. Since it is still in progress, further analysis would be performed for other health outcomes, and logistic models would also be used to compare between the two age groups for the final report.Preliminary analysis hasshown that mental health services, self-efficacy score, sexual behavior, food insecurity, drug use, and incarceration status are some of the significant predictors affecting HIV care and outcomes among adults 18 to 35 of years of age with HIV. It also shows a significant difference in unemployment status, ethnicity and gender distribution, and difference in proportion of individuals adherent to ART, between younger and older people living with HIV. In contrast to prior reports, the current report would also incorporatethe impact of COVID on the outcomes.

***First patient-reported natural history study of Adult Polygucosan Body Disease***

Overview and Student Role Under the guidance of the study chief clinician, Michio Hirano MD, and chief statistician John L P Thompson PhD,my role as the study associate statistician was to help design and implement an analysis plan to better understand the natural history of a rare disease. Using the results of thisanalysis, we plan to develop potential protocols for a more rigorous prospective natural history study to assess candidate outcome measures that can eventually be used to quantify a treatment effect of future new therapies.BackgroundRare diseases in the United States are defined as having less than 200,000 patients [1]. While such case numbers may seem small, an estimated 25 million Americans suffer from any of the ~7000 rare diseases identified in literature [1, 2]. Adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) is an ultra-rare, genetic neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the glycogen branching enzyme gene (GBE1).This disease affectstwo hundred out of ten million people.There is currently nodisease-modifyingtreatmentand no clinical trial program.One publication reportstheretrospective natural history of a small cohort of APBD patients [3]. Our objectives for this projectwere: 1)to maximize the quality of data in a survey administered by the APBD Foundation to its members; 2) provide an initial reportAPBD disease progression and natural history using these data;and3)specify next steps in the process for testing potential new therapies. MethodsThe inclusion criteria for this reportare a self-reported diagnosis of APBD with disease onset at 18 years or older. Surveydata include demographics,age-at-diagnosis, age-at-onset, birth country of parents and grandparents, parents’ consanguinity,and family history of APBD.To achieve our first goal of maximizing data quality, free-text responses on parents’ and grandparents’ countries of birth were standardized; duplicate dataset entries with conflicting information were reconciled; and age-at-onset and age-at-diagnosis were reviewed. Clarification on all variables of interest was sought from patients for whom contact information was available. Variables were updatedfor those who responded andleft blank (missing) for those who did not.Genetic testing results were used when available. Respondentsfound to not have APBD in clinical records available to the clinical team were excluded from the analysis. A detailed database edit log recording all changes and exclusions was created. Results126individuals responded to the initial survey. Afterthedata review and cleaningprocess,96individuals met the inclusion criteria. Median age of APBD onsetis 51 (IQR11),and median age of diagnosis is 57 (IQR 10.5). The most commonprior misdiagnosis wasperipheral neuropathy,which wasreported by 43 patients(60.6%). Other misdiagnoses included spinal stenosis (11), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)(3), multiple sclerosis (MS)(7), prostate cancer(3), and benign prostatic hyperplasia (8). Of the patients whoreported anymisdiagnoses,30 reported one, 15 reported two, and 5 reported three.The majority of patients’ parents were born in the United States, while grandparents were more equally split between the United States, Europe, and Russia. 29 patients(37.2%)reported a family history of APBD, with 26 reporting a 
sibling withahistory of the disease and 5 patients reporting more than one relative with a history.Twelvepatients reported parental consanguinity.Conclusions/DiscussionAPBD has not previously been prospectively studied. The current analysisbegins to providea foundation for further characterization of the disease.The results can be usedto allow more informed planning and design steps for future studies and potential clinical trials for new therapies. Potential biases include recall bias for self-reporting ages-at-onset and diagnosis, as well aslocation bias due to the APBD Foundation being based in the United States. As is usual with ultra-rare diseases, the small sample size presents significant challenges in terms of statistical power; however, this dataset provides the largestbodyof information on APBD patients to date.

***The Association Between Maternal Immune Activation(MIA)and Newborn Brain Development***

Previous research has found that maternal immune activation (MIA)has an impact on the new born brain. However,less research has been focusedon the effect on offspring. The objectiveofthe current study is to examine the association between the MIA indices (inflammatory markers IL-6 and CRP) during pregnancy and the newborn brain cognitive development.Spearmanstatisticwasused to check thecorrelation between the maternal immune markers and newborn Bayley motor score, and the  maternal immune markers in relation to fetal movement. Mediation analysiswas conducted for the pairs that weresignificantlycorrelated. Our resultindicated thatthe 2nd trimester maternal IL6 wassignificantlyassociatedwithnewborn gross motor scoreatthe 4thmonth and fine motor scoreatthe 14thmonth, while maternal CRP was significantlyassociatedwith newborn fine motor scoreatthe 4thmonth.The3rd trimestermaternal IL6 wassignificantlyassociatedwith newborn Bayley Motor Scoresat the 14th month, while maternal CRP was notassociated with newborn Bayley motor scores.In addition, subcortical-left thalamus and medial-left posterior limb internal capsulewere identified as mediator ofthe association pathways on maternal IL6 to newborn Bayley motor scores. The findings have revealed the association of prenatal MIA with brain development and at risk psychiatric disordersin offspring.

***U-Net and Autoencoder Methods for White Matter Hyperintensity Segmentation***

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are lesions in the brain that can indicate cognitive impairment, risk of stroke, or dementia and Alzheimer's disease. These regions must be segmentedin order to be measured,and manual segmentation, the current gold standard, is time consuming. Two machine learning methods, U-Net and autoencoders, were tested to see if they could be used to segment T2-FLAIR MRI images from multiple scanners. U-Nets and autoencoders were developed and trained onimages from healthy participantsand then tested on a different set of images from various scanners. The U-Net had a high dice score coefficient of 0.72 on training and validation data, but only 0.04 on images from other scanners. U-Nets are a promising option for automatic segmentation,but more ground truth data from multiple scanners are needed to adequately train these models. Autoencoders do not appear to be a viable option for automatic WMH segmentation. Although the autoencoder successfully encoded and decoded images from various scanners, WMH regions were not distinguishable from other white matter regions.

***Assessing  Physical andMental Health Differences Between Multiracial  and Single-Race Individuals***

With  a  rapid  increase  ofthemultiracial  population  in  the  U.S.  over  the  past  decade,  literatureon multiracial individuals remains scarce. To have a better understanding of the multiracial identity and to challenge the current risk-based framework, this study examinedwhether individuals identifying asmultiracialhave worsemental and/or physicalhealthfunctioning compared to individuals identifying with a singlerace. A random sample of 2,836 participants were recruited fromAmazon’s Mechanical Turk website to complete a surveyfocused on health, eating, and weight.Self-reported responses from the survey were analyzed andassociations between three separate mentalor physical health functionsand racial identification,using sex,  age,  and  food  security  (as  a  proxy  for  socioeconomic  status)as covariates. A logistic regression model was constructed using these covariates plus physical activity, measured  by  theGodin  Leisure-TimeExerciseQuestionnaire(GLTEQ),to  examine  depressive symptomsmeasured by the Patient Health Questionnaire 2-Items(PHQ-2). It was found that thoseidentifying  as  Nativehad2.67  (95% CI:  1.07,  6.62)times  the  odds  of  having  depressive  symptoms than those identifying as multiracial, while adjusting for sex, age, food security, and physical activity.A  second  logistic  regression  model  was constructed  to  assess  GLTEQ  physical  activity  using  theaforementionedcovariates and it was found thatthose identifying as Black had0.49 (95% CI: 0.25, 0.99)times the odds of being moderate-to-sufficiently active than those identifying as multiracial, while adjusting for sex, age, and food security.Lastly, a linear regression model was constructedto examine physical health functioning, measured by scores on theMedical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey 12-Items (SF-12), using the same covariates. It was found that those identifying as Asian scored2.45 less points, Latinx scored 3.39 less points, Native scored 4.82 less points, and White scored 2.70 less pointson the physical functioning short form (SF-12) than those identifying as multiracial, while adjusting  for  sex,  age,  and  food  security.Individuals  identifying  as  multiracial  did  not  show worsemental  health  and  physical  health  functioning  than  their  single-race  peers  in  this  analysis.  In fact, not only did multiracial individuals not show increased risk of worse physical and mental health functioning,  in  some  cases  they  showed  better  health  functioning  than  those  identifying  as  Asian, Black, Latinx, Native, and White.

***Does Substance Abuse have a Moderating Effect on the Association between Childhood Trauma and Cognition in Adulthood?***

Introduction:There is extensive literature that illustratesa significant,harmful relationship between childhood trauma  and  cognition  in  adulthood.  Despite numerous  studies evaluating the association  of substance  abuse  to  trauma  and to cognition, there issparse research  thatlooks  at  howself-administered  substance  abused  affects  the  association between  later  life  cognition  and  trauma. Thus,the purpose of the study is to conduct an analysis that evaluates whether substance abuse is a significant moderator of the association between childhood trauma and later life cognition. Methods:The study isa secondary analysis utilizing data from the Midlife in the United States longitudinal study (MIDUS). Within this national data set, we will be specifically using cognition data from the second waveof data collection(2004-2006).Our research question will be answered through conducting regression and moderation analysis. Results: To evaluate cognition, we looked at composite cognition, episodic memory, and executive function z-scores,  meanwhile  childhood  trauma  was  split  into  two  categories –threat  and  deprivation scores. Unadjustedanalysis showed that  threat  and  deprivation are significant  predictors  for  all three cognition scores, however the parameter values were low when fitting linear fixed effects models(β<0.01). Prior to moderation analysis, exploratory analysis was conducted to evaluate for confounding  for  covariates  of  race,  age,  sex,  and  education.  Race  and  sex were  consideredbe significant  confounders. From the moderation  analysis,  interaction  effects  between individual substances  and  trauma  scores  were  insignificant  but  interaction  between  overall  drug  use  and trauma was significant.

***A multicenter single-armedopen-labelphase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of JSP191 for hematopoietic cell transplantation conditioning to achieve engraftment and immune reconstitution in subjects with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)***

SCID isa rare immune disorder caused by mutations in different genes involved in the development and function of infection-fighting immune cells that occurs in approximately 1 or fewer births in 100,000 in the United States1. The standard of care for infants with SCID is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation(HCT), although as a life-saving therapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can only partially restore immunity. Even with constant intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy after the transplant, patientsmay still need a second transplant to achieve a better functioning immunity. For patients who are infants or children, chemotherapy-based conditioning is poorly tolerated and can result in major morbidity and mortality. Thus, humanized monoclonal antibody is a safer conditioning regimen for the patient group2. JSP191 is a unique compound developed by Jasper Therapeutics that has shown promising results in clearing hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrowwith high tolerabilityprior to transplant in the preclinical phase. It binds to human CD117, a receptor for stem cell factor (SCF) that is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.The interaction of SCF and CD117 is required for stem cells to survive. JSP191 prevents the binding and thus causes the stem cells to undergo cell death. This creates an empty space in the bone marrow for donor or gene-corrected transplanted cells to engraft. It is designed to address the limitations of current conditioningagents in the aspects of reducing toxicities. Subjects included in the study are children who have undergone a poor HCT soon after birth and would need another one to maintain immunity.The statistical analysis will be conducted with multiple variables of interest. Two primary efficacy endpoints will be considered. The firstis the proportion of subjects achieving adequate donor hematopoietic stem cell engraftment, which is measured by the percentage of donor and CD15+ chimerism. Since the trial is single-armedand longitudinal in nature, a paired t-test will be conducted to test if the chimerism percentage significantly increasesafter the transplant withJSP191 as the conditioning regimen.The second is the proportion of subjects achieving naïve CD4+ T cell production ≥ 85 cells/μL. A proportional t-test will be used.The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to compare thetime to stop IVIG after the prior transplant and the current transplant with JSP191. The proportion of patients experiencing infections will be compared using proportionalt-tests, and the number of infections after the previous and the current transplantwill be compared using the chi-squared test.

***RECIST (v1.1) based Oncology Clinical Trial Data Monitoring, Visualization, and Analytics Application***

The target study is an oncology drug Phase I Safety and Efficacy study, performed by sponsor organizations and their affiliated clinics globally. As per oncology standards, data were collected from 40 patients with advanced solid tumor lesion –demographics, baseline tumor measurements, and other clinical variables. The clinical variables were measured every 4 weeks of treatment, starting from screening to the end of the study (16 weeks). The patient tumor response, measured in percentage change consecutively from each visit measurement (BESTCHG) was recorded and taken as the primary outcome variable. Based on the oncology RECIST v1.1 criteria, we conclude the dependent variable is the patient's overall response to the treatment (OVRSLP). The objective is tobuild an R-shiny application that incorporates RECIST criteria as its main algorithm and visualize individual patient overall response to the treatment, and determine if the patient's BESTCHG and OVRSLP is associated with treatment at the very early phaseof drug development. The dependent variable is a continuous percentage point (BESTCHG), while the independent variable is the factorial patient treatment group. Furthermore, the application is also capable of performing data integrity checks, investigatorvs RECIST criteria consistency checks, and initial survival analysis plotting. Swimmer plots, multi-panel plots, and spider plots are used in the app, and several programming and computational methods are used during the implementation of the app algorithm. As a result, the application can be expanded into different practical studies in solid tumor clinical trials, with major functions in analytics, monitoring, and visualization.

***Novel method:treatment effects utilizingmean duration of response in oncology clinical trials***

Duration of response (DOR) is an important endpoint in oncology clinical trials. In survival analysis,a median DOR is traditionally calculated using Kaplan-Meier curves. However, these Kaplan-Meier curves are typically constructed using observations from responders. In other words, DOR values can be biased when dependent censoring is present. Furthermore, median DOR may not always be informative of treatment efficacy. Insteadof a traditional median DOR, a mean DOR can be calculated using a novel method that utilizes the difference intwo Kaplan-Meier curves—one for progression free survival (PFS) andone for a new composite end point (CEP) that takes the time to the first event among progression, death, or response within the minimum of the maximum time to progression and time to response.The difference in these curves generates another that represents the probability of being in response (PBIR). The area under the PBIR curve produces the desired mean DOR.PBIR curves can be generated for every treatment arm and therefore we can further represent treatment effects as differences in mean DOR.This methodology was initially presented by Huang et al. and was adaptedto a phase three clinical trial data set. Upon comparison with the traditional and novel methods of calculating DOR, median DOR was larger than the mean DOR in all treatment arms. The novelty of this new method is that it utilizes all data pointsfrom responders and non-responders within a datasetand provides a clinically meaningful interpretation of DOR.

***An application for blinded monitoring of pre-defined anticipated serious adverse events during clinical trial conduct***

Patient safety is always top priority in a clinical trial. Therefore, adverse events are collected and monitored in every trial so that if patients are frequently experiencing serious adverse events due to the test drug, the safety data can be unblinded for further analysis so that a decision can be made about stopping the trial before it incurs more harm. Because the US Food and Drug Administration requires reporting of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (SUSAR), I developed an R Shiny application in collaboration with the safety analysis team at Boehringer Ingelheim that will dynamically monitor anticipated, serious adverse events to aid in SUSAR reporting at the company. The app will accept raw safety data and output tables, listings, and figures that will inform the user primarily on how the observed rates of specific adverse events compare with historical rates, but will also provide additional information on individual subjects’ demographics, laboratory test results, concomitant medications,and adverse event duration and severity. The finished product will ultimately be used internally by the pharmacovigilance teams to dynamically conduct blinded safety reviews of each ongoing trial.
